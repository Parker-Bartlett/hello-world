# hello-world
My first repository

Hello!

I'm currently taking my google support specialist certificate and pursuing a career in technology!
I found out about Github through the CodeNewbie podcast while listening to Richard Schneeman. 
Open source seems like a very daunting, yet interesting environment and I'm eager to explore it more!
